to access the java files go to Hospital/src/main/java/com/cr/hospital_management

inside this all the required files will be there 
I used java springboot for this project

all the contents inside the hopital folder is required to run 

to acces the swagger use "http://localhost:8049/swagger-ui.html#/patients-controller/PatientDetailsUsingPOST"
  with the swagger UI only you can able to enter the records
